# PLAYCOM FORK

This is a FORK from the ReDash repository.

Our version lives on the `playcom` branch, which is kept in sync with their latest
master (if stable) when possible.

To update the DB, the easiest procedure is:

 - Deploy the new version on `dev`
 - Use `kubectl -n dev exec -it playcom-redash-xxxx redash-server`
 - Run: `bin/run ./manage.py db upgrade`

> NOTE: Generating the docker image takes a few minutes :)

**_Redash_** is our take on freeing the data within our company in a way that will better fit our culture and usage patterns.

Prior to **_Redash_**, we tried to use traditional BI suites and discovered a set of bloated, technically challenged and slow tools/flows. What we were looking for was a more hacker'ish way to look at data, so we built one.

**_Redash_** was built to allow fast and easy access to billions of records, that we process and collect using Amazon Redshift ("petabyte scale data warehouse" that "speaks" PostgreSQL).
Today **_Redash_** has support for querying multiple databases, including: Redshift, Google BigQuery, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Graphite,
Presto, Google Spreadsheets, Cloudera Impala, Hive and custom scripts.

**_Redash_** consists of two parts:

1. **Query Editor**: think of [JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) for SQL queries. It's your way to share data in the organization in an open way, by sharing both the dataset and the query that generated it. This way everyone can peer review not only the resulting dataset but also the process that generated it. Also it's possible to fork it and generate new datasets and reach new insights.
2. **Visualizations and Dashboards**: once you have a dataset, you can create different visualizations out of it, and then combine several visualizations into a single dashboard. Currently Redash supports charts, pivot table, cohorts and [more](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/visualizations/visualization-types).
